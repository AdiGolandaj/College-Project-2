## An interesting Mandelbrot set visualization that uses SDL library 


### What is this project about ?

Retaining the knowledge gained while learning C++, We made a visualization of a fractal known as Mandelbrot. It basically is a graph that works with the equation given bellow 

$$ f(z) = z^2 +c $$

The Mandelbrot set is defined by a simple iterative process involving complex numbers. The basic idea is to take a complex number 
c and repeatedly apply a function to it. Specifically, the Mandelbrot set is the set of all complex numbers 
C for which the function does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting from  z = 0.

### What is the process involved in it ?

#### Iteration Process

1. Start with a complex number \(c\).
2. Initialize \(z<sub>0</sub> = 0\).
3. Apply the function iteratively: \(z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sub>n</sub><sup>2</sup> + c\).
4. Check if the magnitude of \(z<sub>n</sub>\) remains bounded (i.e., \(|z<sub>n</sub>| \leq 2\)) as \(n\) increases.

### Note This:-

<mark>The repository once pulled onto your device will not work unless you have the SDL/SDL2 library installed ðŸ¤“. In order to run it you can perform the following:</mark>

#### if using windows:
Setup of GCC/G++ via MSYS2 is recommended. the makefile is not necessarily required as we mention the path before compiling in the vscode terminal. 

```
g++ -o help help.cpp -IC:/msys64/mingw64/include/SDL2 -LC:/msys64/mingw64/lib -lSDL2
```
You can also make some changes to the program file itself if you dont want to go through specified way. Being a beginner I dont really have a way to make it work on linux so.... sorry linux users. All of the above knowledge is based of observation and studies conducted while making a mini project for Computer Graphics subject in 2nd year of College. 

I tried doing it with the process showed in many videos but it didn't work for me and hence i found my own way out of it.
